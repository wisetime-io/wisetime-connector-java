# OpenAPI Generator Ignore - Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# You can match any string of characters against a directory, file or extension with a single asterisk (*):
#foo/*/qux

# You can recursively match patterns against a directory, file or extension with a double asterisk (**):
#foo/**/qux

# You can also negate patterns with an exclamation (!).
# For example, you can ignore all files in a docs folder with the file extension .md:
#docs/*.md
# Then explicitly reverse the ignore rule for a single file:
#!docs/README.md
